            </p>
            <p class="test m-3">
                They are native to Sub-Saharan Africa, thriving in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Hippos are well adapted to semi-aquatic environments and spend most of their time submerged in water.

            <p class="test m-3">
                Hippopotamuses are herbivores, feeding on grasses, leaves, and fruit. On average, they live 40-50 years in the wild and weigh between 1500-1800 kg. They stand about 4.5 feet tall at the shoulder.
