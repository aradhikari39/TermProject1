            Cheetahs belong to the Felidae family and are classified as mammals in the order Carnivora.
            </p>
            <p class="test m-3">
            They are native to sub-Saharan Africa, thriving in grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands. Cheetahs are adapted to wide, open spaces where they can use their speed to hunt.
            </p>
            <p class="test m-3">
            Cheetahs are carnivores and primarily hunt small to medium-sized ungulates like gazelles. On average, they live 10-12 years in the wild and weigh between 40-65 kg. They stand about 30 inches tall at the shoulder.
