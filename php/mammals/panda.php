            <p class="test m-3">
                They are native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in bamboo forests of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. Pandas are well adapted to living in dense, cool bamboo forests.

            <p class="test m-3">
                Pandas are herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on bamboo, though they may occasionally eat small animals. On average, they live 20 years in the wild and weigh between 70-100 kg. They stand about 2-3 feet tall at the shoulder.
